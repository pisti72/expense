# Expense tracker

Tracking your expenses is fun. You can see where the money flow out. It can help to save more money by finding the weak points.

# Why I started this project

I downloaded some Android app to track my expenses and I also researched on the Internet to find an mobile friendly simple mobile application to do this task.

I was not fully satisfied all of them. I decided to write one own application and practice REST api development. The coding is ugly. I would like to keep this application as light as possible by avoiding using and 3rd party framework.


# Short term tasks

These are the upcoming tasks which have to be implemented

* User login, logout, creation
* Alter balance add column
* Expense - Income
* Bar graph
* Pie graph
* Edit transaction
